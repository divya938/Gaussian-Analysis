# Gaussian-Analysis
Using this python code one can extract the trajectory of optimized strucutures from the gaussian output file, and also the energy as a function of scan parameters? 

The .xvg will be the output. The energies are given in kcal/mol and the minumum energy value is shifted to 0.0 kcal/mol.
